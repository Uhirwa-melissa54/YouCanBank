# Banking System

This is the banking system I am working on in Java GUI and backend.

I want to make a banking system where users can:
- Log in
- Sign up
- Create an account
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Register for prizes for saving more money

I will use only Java (no Spring Boot), and PostgreSQL will be my database.

Right now, I have finished the Signup Page in Java, and I hope to do well in the other coming features.
